# Az_parking

Az_parking is a parking script working with my other script az_concessionaire, it allows companies to store their purchased vehicles and only to companies, the vehicles registered civil in the Data Base can not be returned.

This script combines two ways of parking, one classic by the property of a garage that will store invisibly your vehicle and the other by storing them as an esx_realparking in full view of all, the vehicle will not depope and will keep its damage (door less, hood removed).

If you want to add new private or public garages go to config/garages and follow the example of the garages already set.
If you want to add new private or public parking, go to config/parkings.

The two remaining files in the config folder are used to configure the classic and police impound points (be careful, the police impound is experimental for the moment, patches will correct it soon!)
