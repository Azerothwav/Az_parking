# Important
Az_parking should be back in a while with new improvements and a total redesign of the system

# Az_parking

Az_parking is a parking script working with my other script az_concessionaire, it allows companies to store their purchased vehicles and only to companies, the vehicles registered civil in the Data Base can not be returned.

This script combines two ways of parking, one classic by the property of a garage that will store invisibly your vehicle and the other by storing them as an esx_realparking in full view of all, the vehicle will not depope and will keep its damage (door less, hood removed).
